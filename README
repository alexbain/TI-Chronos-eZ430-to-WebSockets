You know what's cool? Smart devices.

You know what's really cool? Making smart devices communicate seamlessly with the web.

This is a short and sweet Ruby script that gets your TI Chronos eZ430 watch emitting WebSockets events.

Why would you want to do that? A couple ideas:

* Write a chrome extension that watches for events and does something neat:
  * Retweets the active tab
  * Saves an article to Instapaper
  * Goes to the next message in GMail
  * Closes all the open tabs
* Write web apps? Bind a watch button to run your tests or deploy your app.
* Have another embedded system that speaks WebSocket? Tap a watch button and trigger an event on the device.

The options are endless.

Do something cool? Let me know! I'd love to hear about it.
