This is a short Ruby script that gets your TI Chronos eZ430 watch (http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/EZ430-Chronos) emitting WebSockets events. Right now it'll capture top left, top right, and bottom left button presses when the watch is in PPT mode and connected to a computer.

Once it captures these button presses it sends off WebSockets events to Pusher.com (a nice WebSockets API).

Why would you want to do that? Lots of reasons. Here area a couple ideas:

* Write a chrome extension that watches for WebSockets events from your watch and:
  * Retweets the active tab to Twitter
  * Save an article to Instapaper
  * Go to the next message in GMail
  * Close all the open tabs
  * Open a series of browser tabs set to specific URLs.
  * Anything your heart imagines.
* Do you write web apps? Write a script that watches for WebSockets events and bind a watch button to run your tests or deploy your app.
* Have another embedded system that speaks WebSockets? Tap a watch button and trigger an event on the device.

The options are endless.

Getting started:

# Create a pusher.com API account (Free 100k messages per day)
# Edit serial_interface.rb and add your Pusher.com credentials
# Install these gems:

    gem install ruby-serialport
    gem install pusher

# Start the script:

    ruby serial_interface.rb

# Put your watch in PPT mode, start hitting some buttons
# Code something great since your watch now talks to the web


Write something cool? Let me know! I'd love to hear about it.
