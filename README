You know what's cool? Smart devices.

You know what's really cool? Making smart devices communicate seamlessly with the web.

This is a short and sweet Ruby script that gets your TI Chronos eZ430 watch emitting WebSockets events.

Why would you want to do that? A couple ideas:

* Write a chrome extension that watches for WebSockets events and:
  * Retweets the active tab
  * Saves an article to Instapaper
  * Goes to the next message in GMail
  * Closes all the open tabs
* Write web apps? Bind a watch button to run your tests or deploy your app.
* Have another embedded system that speaks WebSocket? Tap a watch button and trigger an event on the device.

The options are endless.

Getting started:

# Setup a pusher.com API account (Free 100k messages per day)
# Edit serial_interface.rb and set your Pusher.com credentials
# Install the gems:

    gem install ruby-serialport
    gem install pusher

# Start the script:

    ruby serial_interface.rb

# Put your watch in PPT mode, hit some buttons
# Code something great since your watch is talking to the web


Write something cool? Let me know! I'd love to hear about it.
